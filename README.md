# Vanilla-Enhanced
 My first old mod for 1.7.10. Be sure to wear a hazmat suit before continuing, this code is awful. Has the occasional good idea but is mostly mid at best.
 The only parts of this that have been modified from its last changes in 2018/2019 are the textures of ruby and sapphire ore, and their blocks. As these used textures from a proprietary mod, I've replaced them with the ProjectRed versions instead, which are MIT. Additionally, the osmium ore has been edited from vanilla's emerald ore for the same reason. This mod otherwise remains unchanged from its last state that I touched it as a noob. Have fun!


## THIS PROJECT IS ABANDONED! NO SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED!
 The purpose of this release is to make my old code available to the public for easier reference by me and others. No builds will be provided.
